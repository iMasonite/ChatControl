# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This file support creating custom handlers that
# works with user-defined rules.
#
# The purpose of handlers is to group a set of actions when
# a message is caught by a rule. This not only saves a bunch
# of repeative code but makes it more human fail proof and
# future proof.
#
# It supports unicode characters when saved in UTF-8
# encoding. Tested on Notepad++
# WordPad or Notepad on Windows are known to cause issues!
#
# To NOT display a message, set it to 'none'

# And example of usage. The name is case sensitive.
